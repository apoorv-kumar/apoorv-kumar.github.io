With experience building teams at finance behemoths to startups, I can help you assess the right team combination for your goals before, during and after the hiring process to ensure timely product delivery.

Hiring the right team is a prerequisite to building a good business. Same applies to a tech platform. Recruitment agencies can tell you how to reach out to prospect employees and set up interviews but they are grossly under-equipped to tell you how you should structure a team in terms of hierarchy, number of seniors/juniors and number of people allocated to each part of the infrastructure. Every organization has very unique requirements depending upon its funding stage, business idea and growth strategy. I've built successful teams for one of the largest finance institutions in the world and done the same for a seed funded startup that grew to be a full fledged NBFC.
