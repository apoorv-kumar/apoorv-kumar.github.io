I have a keen instinct for building teams and systems. I've built and managed both teams and platforms for organizations of all sizes over the last 7 years. In terms of infrastructure, my designed systems have scaled 10x effortlessly at extremely low costs. The teams I built and then managed were extremely lean and besides showing remarkable project executions, had little to not attrition due to great employee engagement and development measures.
